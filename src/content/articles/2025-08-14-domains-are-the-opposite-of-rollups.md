title: Domains are the opposite of rollups

summary: delta domains are not simpler than blockchains, they're better

If you squint, delta looks a lot like some kind of L1-L2 rollup ecosystem like Ethereum or Celestia. When we were raising our seed a bit more than a year ago, investors (the ones who liked us) would often say things like “this is what rollup-centric Ethereum would have been if it was designed today”. In the same way that rollups make it easy for anyone to deploy a blockchain, turning your existing app into a delta domain would be as simple as adding a few lines of APIs.

But this is totally wrong. The reality is that delta enables *more*, not less advanced verifiable systems and applications than blockchains. delta does not solve the problem of deploying a blockchain with minimal development work and opex. For this, you should build a rollup, and more specifically use a service such as [Conduit](https://www.conduit.xyz/) or [Evolve](https://ev.xyz/). Deploy a blockchain in 30 seconds.

In contrast, delta domains are not simpler than blockchains. They’re more powerful. While you *could* make a basic rollup-like execution environment, delta enables you to do so much more. Domains are more expressive, flexible, and scalable than blockchains; they can internalize enormously heavy Web2 machinery like weather simulation models or AI, or Web3 machinery such as indexers, on-/off-ramps, and bridges; they can ingest huge amounts of data at the latency of the internet without relying on oracles; and so on.

Rollups are lightweight; delta applications can be insanely heavy, just like real-world systems. Because they are real-world systems. While smart contracts are practically size-bounded at a couple of thousands lines of code, delta-based systems are not constrained by gas costs and can feasibly extend into the tens of millions and beyond, as is generally required in Web2.

Building a genuinely useful delta application will definitely require a ton of work, as is the case for all real-world software. delta’s purpose is to raise the ceiling of blockchain-like systems way beyond the current state of things. 

At the time of writing, Stripe and Circle have just dropped new L1s, and people on X are arguing whether they should have instead built L2s, since you can build essentially equivalent systems at a much lower cost. The decision to make a Circle domain would not be based on the cost saving of the single operator, but on adding features like fraud-protection and AML; it would not make sense for Stripe to launch a domain just to save on DA fees, but potentially to enable smart contract-like automated flows beyond the blockchain, across its internal systems.

Expect a lot more content showcasing exactly what types of new applications are made possible by delta.
